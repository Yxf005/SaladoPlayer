	SaladoPlayer contains option that fixes problem of both zooming panorama in/out and scrolling page at the same time
	when using mouse wheel. MouseWheelTrap overcomes this Flash Player bug and scrolling zooms panorama in/out ONLY.
	This option is enabled by default. MouseWheelTrap was created by Liam O'Donnell http://www.spikything.com/
