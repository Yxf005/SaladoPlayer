<p>Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".</p>

<p>Oh God, what have I done? No, she'll probably make me do it. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</p> 
<ul><li>This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</li><li>Okay, I like a challenge.</li><li>Soothe us with sweet lies.</li><li>I never loved you.</li><li>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.</li></ul>

<p>You are the last hope of the universe. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared&hellip; Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!</p>

<p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! No, I'm Santa Claus! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Hey, whatcha watching? When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</p>
